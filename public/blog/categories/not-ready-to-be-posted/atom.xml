    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first started programming, I hated javascript (and hated web development i general, I wanted to go Windows Forms). As the years goes, I finally started to see something beautifull doint web. I really started to love it, really. But that's not the point.</p>

<p>Javascript was hard and a lot of bugs where always hauting me doing maintenance or bug fixes. When Ajax was starting to go mainstream and we started to do it with the .Net UpdatePanel. I was afraid.</p>

<p>The jQuery came up. JQuery seemed to make everything easy and I started slowly to use it more in my projects. I was careful. Then I heard that some people were trying to do unit test on it and well, how could you do that.</p>

<p>Then Rails and ASP.NET MVC entered my life. This is a separate topic, but I think the mvc paradigm is the way to go until something really better take the place. It was a lot more easy to use javascript with your app (No automatic naming, grrrr ASP.NET WebForms).</p>

<p>The reality really struck me earlier this year. Javascript is great and if you forget some of the bad stuff, there is something pretty great to be done with it. I started going all the way with it.</p>

<p>I still use jQuery a lot, but the exciting thing happening, is that I start to use it less and less for simple things that could be achieved without it. And starting to go OO with it (I still think I have a hell of a long way to be able to use that.)</p>
