  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me start by telling you that I strongly believe in agile software development. Agile for me is about rapid feedback, improvement and a chance for all team members to give their opinions (and a lot more). Far too often I have seen developers only following wishes and desires of their lead programmer and never been asked for their opinions (it&rsquo;s not a personal experience but this is what I have heard many times). And I don&rsquo;t think it works.</p>


<p>Recently, I have been assigned to help a team that just got started on the agile path. They want to do it with Scrum and XP. I have not been sent specifically to help them with the agile transition but since I got some experience I think I could be of some help.</p>


<p>The new team has a great willingness to learn and improve themselves and finding a better team and a better project would have been possible for this transition. If there is a team that will successfully make it happen, it&rsquo;s them. Our Scrum master is using the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches" target="_blank">Scrum and XP from the Trenches</a>&rdquo; book written by <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/" target="_blank">Henri Kniberg</a> as a reference and so far, it&rsquo;s working amazingly. I did not had time to read it yet, but I plan to purchase the book as soon as I have some free time (I&rsquo;m getting married and having a baby).</p>


<p>We are experimenting different things and and seeing by ourselves what works and what is not. So far we already implemented the daily meeting, user stories and an integration server. We also make use of &ldquo;story point&rdquo;, but for us, one point is one hour. We also use a burndown chart to track the effort we make (as I said: rapid feedback).</p>


<p>It&rsquo;s also a learning experience for me. I got to read a lot more and have been asked frequently to give feedback. So I&rsquo;m not letting myself go with the flow and only live the experience, but I am asked to participate actively. In the past, I have been on an agile team but as a remote worker (and a lot of distraction at the time, read : new house) and did not fully lived the experience. I also tried by myself on a lot of one-person project but, it&rsquo;s not just the same.</p>


<p>We have configured a build server and now we are trying to write more tests (just me for the moment, since I got &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; experience with that (3-4 years, wow time goes fast)).&nbsp; One thing I would like to apply as soon as possible is the use of TDD or BDD. But this one will be a lot harder to be approved since it&rsquo;s a considerable overhead when the team have no experience and a lot harder to get started correctly.</p>


<p>Happy to be back on the Agile train.</p>

<time datetime="2009-09-23T05:52:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 23<span>rd</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To be honest, I believe that we have reached a point where we can&rsquo;t allow ourselves to deliver untested software. I lived through a lot of maintenance work and debugging that were so time consuming that It took more time to debug than it took to actually develop. And it&rsquo;s for that reason that I believe that unit tests are essentials and should belong to every developer toolbox.</p>


<h3>Easy to get started</h3>


<p>It&rsquo;s actually not so hard to learn and a lot of resources already exists to get you started rapidly (<a title="Roy Osherove blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ROsherove/" target="_blank">Roy Osherove</a> and <a title="Art of unit testing" href="http://www.artofunittesting.com/" target="_blank">his book</a> are a must).</p>


<h3>Unit test and design</h3>


<p>I also believe that unit tests have a strong positive impact to the design of the code. Doing correctly, TDD (test-driven-design or test-driven development) is a powerful tool. I&rsquo;m talking with experience here and it&rsquo;s very impressive. I worked on two almost identical project and one was driven by test and the other was not. The quality of the design was much much better on the project that was test driven than the other one. But what was way more impressive was the number of changes made to the structure of the project. Code with tests has evolved tremendously and untested code had a static structure that stayed the same over the course of it&rsquo;s development.</p>


<h3>Unit test as a learning tool</h3>


<p>And a great one it is. I recently had to create regular expression to find email in some large text file. Instead of rapidly hitting google for a rapid solution, I created a class library, added the nUnit framework and started writing tests. This way, I could test assumptions and learn some aspect of writing regular expressions. I learned a lot.</p>


<h3>I can&rsquo;t believe!</h3>


<p>Today, I can&rsquo;t believe myself when I see a method that contains logical code, and no tests. Tests are so easy to do (when you actually know how to do them) that it&rsquo;s almost a shame to forget about them.</p>


<h3>My answer</h3>


<p>And here is my answer to the &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t do test because our organization don&rsquo;t want to&rdquo; argument : Don&rsquo;t tell them. You are responsible for the quality of your code and it&rsquo;s very unprofessional to leave code go in production that you knew would have been much better and feel more confident if it was tested. I believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages in this particular case.</p>


<p>This is my point of view.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a list of common errors I had while working with the System.Diagnostics.Process class. I listed all solutions that worked for me.</p>


<h3>Couldn&#8217;t connect to remote machine.</h3>


<p><strong>Solution 1</strong> : Open MMC (Start/Run/mmc), add the Services snap-in and enter the name of the machine you are trying to connect to. This should give the exact reason it&rsquo;s failing.</p>


<p><strong>Solution 2</strong> : The inner exception could give you more information.</p>


<p><strong>Solution 3</strong> : You need server permission.</p>


<p><strong>Solution 4</strong> : Common on Windows 7 and Vista, start the <strong>Remote Registry</strong> service.</p>


<h3>The RPC server is unavailable</h3>


<p><strong>Solution </strong>: Turn on <strong>File and printer sharing </strong>and make sure the firewall is configured to allow access.</p>


<h3>Access Is Denied</h3>


<p><strong>Solution</strong> : In case nothing worked out of Google, try this : Open Local Security Policy and make sure the <strong>&ldquo;Set Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts&rdquo;</strong> to <strong>Classic.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, it&#8217;s another meta-blogging post (see Jeff Atwood post on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000297.html" target="_blank">meta-blogging</a>). But I think it&#8217;s a relevant one. I finally made the big move and decided to use an hosting provider to host my blog. And more importantly, I switched from <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> to <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/" target="_blank">BlogEngine.Net</a>.</p>


<p><strong>How I made the choice to go with BlogEngine.NET?</strong></p>


<p>Back in July, I decided to create my own blog engine. So I began the development with exactly what I had in mind for the most fantastical blog ever. After a week and really slow progress (I was sure to finish development by the beginning of August, 1 month later), I decided to look at other blog engines to gather idea on architecture and what is needed to be implemented. I looked at Oxite and BlogEngine.NET (since they are in .NET). I had a big surprise. I haven&#8217;t realized coding your own blog was so much work. In fact, BlogEngine.NET was already doing everything that I wanted (except for extension-less url).&nbsp;</p>


<p>And the ability to write your own theme is so easy! The BlogEngine.NET really did done a good job.</p>


<p><strong>How was the migration?</strong></p>


<p>Horrific. WordPress use a proprietary format and can&#8217;t be imported directly into BlogEngine.NET. But it was no big deal since I wanted to reread all post and correct spelling and bad grammar, I decided to recreate them all. I used the WordPress statistics to know which post were the most read and done them first.</p>


<p><strong>Uploading to GoDaddy.</strong></p>


<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in hosting server. I guess the experience was relatively easy, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that I abandoned after 2 hours and when getting back, everything was working as expected. The important thing is that it worked and it&rsquo;s fast.</p>


<p><strong>My apologies to Wordpress.</strong></p>


<p>I have nothing against you, really. You are a great service and a wonderful blogging platform. For 2 years you made blogging a unique experience. But my world is in .NET and you are not written in it. But again, thank you!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/">NDepend</a> on various project I am working on and there is so much to say that I can&rsquo;t wait to do a full review because I will make you wait too long. I got a free license and wanted you to know what the tool can do and what were my impression.</p>


<p>First of all NDepend is a tool that analyse your code. It&rsquo;s huge! Definitely not a tool you can learn in an hour or two. Simply give the tool a solution or project file and start analyzing. You are first presented with a a complete map of your application. By default it shows all your code sorted by the number of lines but you can quickly switch by different kinds of metrics (LOC, Cyclomatic Complexity, IL instructions, Efferent coupling, etc.).</p>


<p><a title="ndependcomplete" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63483657@N00/3724199730/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/3439/3724199730_0127dffd0b.jpg" border="0" alt="ndependcomplete" width="680" height="516" /></a></p>


<p>The best part is that you can write query against your code. This feature is called CQL (custom query language). Need to know which method have more than 200 lines of code? No problem. Really. It looks like SQL and is easy to write (I haven&rsquo;t written any yet, but I&rsquo;m sure it will prove useful later).</p>


<p>Take a look at this :</p>


<div id="scid:57F11A72-B0E5-49c7-9094-E3A15BD5B5E6:42d5c7d5-dae6-4381-bb88-43e02dd5509e" class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="display:inline;float:none;margin:0;padding:0;">
<pre style="background-color:White;white-space:-moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;overflow: auto;"><span style="color: #008000;">//</span><span style="color: #008000;"> &lt;Name&gt;Methods with too many local variables (NbVariables)&lt;/Name&gt;</span><span style="color: #008000;">
</span><span style="color: #000000;">WARN IF Count </span><span style="color: #000000;">&gt;</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #800080;">0</span><span style="color: #000000;"> IN SELECT TOP </span><span style="color: #800080;">10</span><span style="color: #000000;"> METHODS WHERE NbVariables </span><span style="color: #000000;">&gt;</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #800080;">15</span><span style="color: #000000;"> ORDER BY NbVariables DESC</span></pre>
<!-- Code inserted with Steve Dunn's Windows Live Writer Code Formatter Plugin.  http://dunnhq.com --></div>


<p>Out of the box, NDepend provide around 200 CQL queries. It has queries to find unused or dead code, find which method are not test covered, naming convention not respected, types with too many methods, ect. Each rules has a short description on what it does and even provide links to more complete documentation if needed. It also has intellisence as if this wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>


<p>A cool feature is the dependency matrix. It&rsquo;s easy to see where is your dependencies.</p>


<p><a title="ndependmatrix" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63483657@N00/3723410225/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/3420/3723410225_31dfb32f18.jpg" border="0" alt="ndependmatrix" /></a></p>


<p>The tools itself is beautiful, it make us want to play more with it (it does not use WPF, but it appears to).</p>


<p>A lot of features that I haven&rsquo;t used yet are :</p>


<ul>
<li>Compare assemblies</li>
<li>Code Coverage</li>
<li>Writing complex&nbsp; custom rules</li>
</ul>


<p>I recently came across this post entry by <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/">Patrick Smacchia</a> (creator of NDepend) that used the tools to spot bugs in an existing code base (<a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2009/06/21/agile-behavior-nurture-knowledge-database.aspx">http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2009/06/21/agile-behavior-nurture-knowledge-database.aspx</a>). I don&rsquo;t know why but this has really struck me and kept it in my favourites. I could write custom query to spot bad practices and potential bugs.</p>


<p>But there is a downside. On a project I worked last year. Every query that has been executed had a warning on it, almost every single one. That&rsquo;s sad. I almost cried. But I&rsquo;m fine now. NDepend will help me.</p>


<p>There is so much to say, that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to cover it all in one single post. I&rsquo;ll continue to use it and post any relevant information and features that I really enjoyed in the next couple of weeks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m way too late to post the conclusion of the trial, but for all of you who wanted to know here are the results.</p>


<p>Will I continue to use vi/Vim in my everyday life? Probably. But not for a little while. The experience was fun but I did not find that my productivity increased a lot. I can&rsquo;t really say for sure. The problem I had was that I did not have a proper typing technique. So I found myself distracted because I was hitting the wrong key and caused side effects. So, I came to the conclusion that I needed to learn how to type properly.</p>


<p>I have already started to follow the lessons provided by <a href="http://www.typeonline.co.uk/">typeonline.co.uk</a>. And while typing with the proper skill in Visual Studio, I found myself missing <a href="http://www.viemu.com/">viEmu</a> real bad. I did not wanted to remove my hand from the keyboard to move around. Having seen what vi/vim was capable of, it&rsquo;s a huge way back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That was disastrous. No really. I had a lot of modifications to be made fast and it just seemed that viEmu was always in the way. I&rsquo;m not blaming viEmu here, it&rsquo;s just because I was not completely comfortable with it and I should had it deactivated for the rush. On another side, I learned how to do search without using Ctrl-F. Disturbing at first, a must now. 24 days left.</p>
