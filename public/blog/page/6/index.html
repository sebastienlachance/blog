  <div class="entry-content"><p>2009 has been a big year. A lot happened. Professionally and in my life in general.</p>


<h2>What went well</h2>


<h3>Reading other books than technical books</h3>


<p>I have been reading a lot of books that had nothing to do with the technical aspect of my job, but with other challenges in mind. I&rsquo;ve read about business development, learning process, design (not software design) and project management. I&rsquo;ve also came in contact with the Pragmatic Thinking and Learning book which gave me a lot of great tools to learn more effectively.</p>


<h3>Agile</h3>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with an Agile Team for half a year now, going back where I really belong. I liked the experience and hope we (the team) can get even more benefits from this methodology this year. I&rsquo;ve also assisted to some of the conferences of the Agile Tour 2009 which was a fantastic event.</p>


<h3>Web Development and Javascript</h3>


<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a developer with a little knowledge of web design but no deep knowledge. I&rsquo;ve always had design supplied to me and been able to hack through it and get thing done. This year, I&rsquo;ve gone deeply in web design and CSS, so deeply that I now really hate browsers differences :). And I&rsquo;m now an expert in Javascript, thanks to jQuery. Seriously, I made really big improvement on this side.</p>


<h3>SEO</h3>


<p>Search Engine Optimization that his. I was expected to increase visitors from the US on a website. I&rsquo;ve started with no real knowledge on how Google was indexing content. So I geared myself, watched videos and read everything I could for this. It&rsquo;s not always easy but it was a fun learning experience. One tool worth mentioning is the IIS SEO toolkit. The first analysis with this extensions showed me that I had a lot of problems with missing descriptions, keywords, titles, broken links, etc, on my blog, and it provided a great experience in allowing me to resolve them and understand what I did wrong.</p>


<h3>Wedding</h3>


<p>I&rsquo;m now married. Since October 17. What an intense ride it was. And we are now waiting for our first child to be born (due February 2010).</p>


<h3>Consulting</h3>


<p>I&rsquo;ve done some consulting work at the beginning of the year and it was really fun. Delivered on time and exactly what they wanted. Great experience. Great customer.</p>


<h2>What could have been better</h2>


<h3>Lack of time to post on my blog and the migration to BlogEngine.</h3>


<p>I have missed a lot of opportunity to blog and I intend to get back on track this year. I also migrated my blog from Wordpress to BlogEngine.Net this summer and seen a drop of more than 50% in traffic. I blame myself for my lack of migration strategy.</p>


<h3>Technical Reading</h3>


<p>I read some technical books in 2009, but not as many as the other years. In fact, aside from Clean Code, CSS Web Design and ASP.NET MVC in action, I had read no other technical book.</p>


<h3>A contract</h3>


<p>A situation has occurred in which I was unable to deliver a project on time. Some deadline were too thigh and a last minute change (technology switch at the last minute) made the situation goes havoc and the project was abandoned (by me).</p>


<h3>Skullcandy headphones</h3>


<p>I had a pair of Skullcandy headphones that broke unexpectedly. But due to the formidable warranty (complete replacement or half-price on another pair), I had sent them to be replaced in October. I&rsquo;m still waiting and all my attempt to contact them has failed. The problem is that I would have been able to repair them myself and now I&rsquo;ve just lost them.<br /><strong>Update 1 (January 14, 2010 : It seems the package never arrived&hellip;</strong>). <br /><strong>Update 2 (January 19, 2010 : Now they found it and the new headphones are being returned to me.</strong><br /><strong>Update 3 (February 11, 2010) : 3 weeks now and still haven&#8217;t received them (Canada Post is slow or &#8230;).</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Edit : This is an old post back from november 2008 on my old blog. Since I had this problem today, I though it would be a good idea to share it again with all my readers.</strong></p>


<p>Going back to standard ASP.NET Web Forms was ridiculously hard. In the last months, I have been completely blown away by the limitless (almost) possibilities of the ASP.NET MVC framework and now I find myself struggling very hard to make a single dropdownlist works the way I wanted to. The scenario was simple, in the client page, I used the value supplied by the drowdown list item to make an AJAX query and display the incoming results somewhere else in the page. That should be very easy right? Well, no. You may not know this but the value attribute of the ASP.NET CheckBoxList&#8217;s items is not rendered at all.</p>


<p>I know that there is multiple solutions to render it, but that&#8217;s not the point. I can&#8217;t find a single reason to not let the developer decide if he want to display it or not. I even heard on some forum (I did not test it myself) that you cannot add a custom attribute named &#8220;value&#8221; (you can add custom attributes to any controls that will be rendered in the final html) without it to be stripped by the ASP.NET WebForms engine.</p>


<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s see the solution to this problem.</p>


<p>First of all, we need to create a custom control that will inherit from the <strong>System.Web.UI.WebControls.CheckBoxList</strong> and that will implement the <strong>System.Web.UI.WebControls.IRepeatInfoUser</strong>. We use the base class <strong>CheckBoxList </strong>as we want to reuse existing behavior without implementing it ourselves. As for the IRepeatInfoUser interface, we use it because we are implementing a control that has list items.</p>


<div>
<pre style="border-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; overflow: visible; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,'Courier New',courier,monospace; color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff">public</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">class</span> CheckBoxListFixed : CheckBoxList, IRepeatInfoUser
{
    <span style="color: #0000ff">void</span> IRepeatInfoUser.RenderItem(ListItemType itemType, <span style="color: #0000ff">int</span> repeatIndex, RepeatInfo repeatInfo, HtmlTextWriter writer)
    {

    }
}</pre>
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Inside the RenderItem method we will use the HtmlTextWriter to output all the wanted html.&nbsp; So we want to create an input of type checkbox:</p>


<div>
<pre style="border-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; overflow: visible; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,'Courier New',courier,monospace; color: black; font-size: 8pt;">writer.WriteBeginTag(<span style="color: #006080">"input"</span>);
writer.WriteAttribute(<span style="color: #006080">"type"</span>, <span style="color: #006080">"checkbox"</span>);
writer.Write(<span style="color: #006080">"&gt;"</span>);
writer.Write(Items[repeatIndex].Text);
writer.WriteEndTag(<span style="color: #006080">"input"</span>);</pre>
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>This will render only basic checkboxes.</p>


<div>
<pre style="border-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; overflow: visible; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,'Courier New',courier,monospace; color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff">&lt;</span><span style="color: #800000">table</span> <span style="color: #ff0000">id</span><span style="color: #0000ff">="checkboxList"</span> <span style="color: #ff0000">border</span><span style="color: #0000ff">="0"</span><span style="color: #0000ff">&gt;</span>

</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>With no IDs or attributes. Let&#8217;s add those to each checkbox.</p>


<div>
<pre style="border-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; overflow: visible; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,'Courier New',courier,monospace; color: black; font-size: 8pt;">writer.WriteBeginTag("input");
writer.WriteAttribute("type", "checkbox");
writer.WriteAttribute("name", UniqueID + this.IdSeparator + repeatIndex.ToString(NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo));
writer.WriteAttribute("id", ClientID + this.ClientIDSeparator + repeatIndex.ToString(NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo));
           
if (Items[repeatIndex].Selected)
    writer.WriteAttribute("checked", "checked");

System.Web.UI.AttributeCollection attrs = Items[repeatIndex].Attributes;
foreach (string key in attrs.Keys)
{
    writer.WriteAttribute(key, attrs[key]);
}
writer.Write("<span style="color: #0000ff">&gt;</span>");
writer.Write(Items[repeatIndex].Text);
writer.WriteEndTag("input");</pre>
</div>


<div>&nbsp;</div>


<p>We have also added the &#8220;checked&#8221; to each checkbox. Now we are ready to insert the &#8220;missing&#8221; value attribute. Adding the following line will resolve the problem.</p>


<div>
<pre style="border-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; overflow: visible; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,'Courier New',courier,monospace; color: black; font-size: 8pt;">writer.WriteAttribute("value", Items[repeatIndex].Value);</pre>
</div>


<div>&nbsp;</div>


<p>Complete control code :</p>


<div>
<pre style="border-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; overflow: visible; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,'Courier New',courier,monospace; color: black; font-size: 8pt;">namespace yourNamespace
{
    public class CheckBoxListFixed : CheckBoxList, IRepeatInfoUser
    {
        void IRepeatInfoUser.RenderItem(ListItemType itemType, int repeatIndex, RepeatInfo repeatInfo, HtmlTextWriter writer)
        {
            writer.WriteBeginTag("input");
            writer.WriteAttribute("type", "checkbox");
            writer.WriteAttribute("name", UniqueID + this.IdSeparator + repeatIndex.ToString(NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo));
            writer.WriteAttribute("id", ClientID + this.ClientIDSeparator + repeatIndex.ToString(NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo));
            writer.WriteAttribute("value", Items[repeatIndex].Value);
            if (Items[repeatIndex].Selected)
                writer.WriteAttribute("checked", "checked");
            System.Web.UI.AttributeCollection attrs = Items[repeatIndex].Attributes;
            foreach (string key in attrs.Keys)
            {
                writer.WriteAttribute(key, attrs[key]);
            }
            writer.Write("<span style="color: #0000ff">&gt;</span>");
            writer.Write(Items[repeatIndex].Text);
            writer.WriteEndTag("input");
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>And here is a bonus : <strong>How to use this control in my code?</strong></p>


<p>Supposing the control isn&#8217;t in another library and that you cannot add it to your toolbox, you can always use the Register directive inside your aspx file.</p>


<div>
<pre style="border-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; overflow: visible; line-height: 12pt; background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,'Courier New',courier,monospace; color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="background-color: #ffff00">&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix="yourPrefix" Namespace="yourNamespace" %&gt;</span></pre>
</div>


<p>Next, you can declare your control with the format</p>


<p><strong>&lt;<em>tagprefix:</em>CheckboxListFixed runat=&#8221;server&#8221; id=&#8221;yourID&#8221; /&gt;</strong></p>

<p>I have enjoyed it so much that I had to sent an email to Andy Hunt (the author) to tell him how much I appreciated his effort to write this wonderful book.</p>


<blockquote>
<blockquote>I have just finished reading Pragmatic Thinking and Learning a few moments ago and I believe it&#8217;s a wonderful book.</blockquote>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<blockquote>I haven&#8217;t had much interest in reading computer related book so much as this one for a long time. I have a strong interest in the content you provided and will begin to apply what I can right now. Starting by re-reading the book and doing a Mind Map to be sure I picked all the interesting stuff.</blockquote>
<p>Excellent!&nbsp; If you have a chance, please post some happy comments like these on <a href="http://amazon.com">amazon.com</a>.&nbsp; It really helps.       <br />Good luck, and all the best!       <br />/\ndy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>This book is about the process of learning and thinking. How the brain works. But with an programmer point of view.&nbsp; Andy Hunt start by showing the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition which is describing the different type of skill level and how you go between them. Just for the info, the Dreyfus model has 5 levels : Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, Expert. He describe each level in detail and how to recognize it. And most importantly, how to act accordingly.</p>


<p>He also describe the R and L mode (left brain and right brain) and how to improve the flow between them. This is how you can remember think without thinking.</p>


<p>There is also a lot of the content dedicated to various method to &ldquo;refactor&rdquo; your brain. Each one is focused on being a better learner or to think more efficiently. Morning pages, mind map, SQ3R, etc.</p>


<p>I even had to apply some techniques described right away. Doing a mind map of what I&rsquo;m trying to figure out or when I&rsquo;m trying to absorb knowledge has helped me tremendously. It&rsquo;s been almost a month now and I see some improvements.</p>


<p>I like to learn something new everyday and care a lot of the quality of what I am learning. So, it&rsquo;s the reason I must give 4.9 star out of 5 (and yes, I will post a review on Amazon Mister Hunt).</p>

If you haven&rsquo;t read it yet, go read it and be objective.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>Simple is better, less is better</h3>


<p>I agree with him, really! Not totally, but the essence of what I believe is written there. It&rsquo;s all about simplicity. I want my code to be simple. If I need to figure out what it&rsquo;s doing, I will refactor it until I can understand it easily. And I will never consider the use of a framework or another piece of technology if I really don&rsquo;t need it. Adding things for fun or for learning purpose can be fun, but it&rsquo;s not the most important aspect of software development.</p>


<p>I just want to stay away from complicated stuff. Simpler is better. Less is better. If there is a way to accomplish a task easily without a grandiose architecture, then I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>


<p>And don&rsquo;t forget that the ultimate goal is to ship it!</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>TDD</h3>


<p>But, I refuse to let TDD down. I don&rsquo;t know why everyone else is talking about Joel hatred concerning unit testing (am I to only one not reading his blog religiously?) but I need to put my feet here and give my opinion about TDD in this context. TDD allow me to write simple code. Just what is needed and nothing else. I don&rsquo;t think it slows me down. I don&rsquo;t think it gave me a lot more speed on my productivity, but it sure as hell helped me a lot in making things simple. But! Yes It could slow down dramatically a new team that has never done any sort of unit testing. Why not, you need to think a lot more of how you are going&nbsp; to do things and it&rsquo;s not easy to get out of the &ldquo;write and forget about until we test&rdquo; state of mind.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>TDD and 100% code coverage</h3>


<p>One of the aspect of unit testing that can be a problem is the 100% code coverage mark. Most people are trying to test everything and will put a lot of effort in it. Why should it be important to cover every single line of code. Not everything should be tested. Automatic property in C# should not be tested. Use your judgement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me start by telling you that I strongly believe in agile software development. Agile for me is about rapid feedback, improvement and a chance for all team members to give their opinions (and a lot more). Far too often I have seen developers only following wishes and desires of their lead programmer and never been asked for their opinions (it&rsquo;s not a personal experience but this is what I have heard many times). And I don&rsquo;t think it works.</p>


<p>Recently, I have been assigned to help a team that just got started on the agile path. They want to do it with Scrum and XP. I have not been sent specifically to help them with the agile transition but since I got some experience I think I could be of some help.</p>


<p>The new team has a great willingness to learn and improve themselves and finding a better team and a better project would have been possible for this transition. If there is a team that will successfully make it happen, it&rsquo;s them. Our Scrum master is using the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches" target="_blank">Scrum and XP from the Trenches</a>&rdquo; book written by <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/" target="_blank">Henri Kniberg</a> as a reference and so far, it&rsquo;s working amazingly. I did not had time to read it yet, but I plan to purchase the book as soon as I have some free time (I&rsquo;m getting married and having a baby).</p>


<p>We are experimenting different things and and seeing by ourselves what works and what is not. So far we already implemented the daily meeting, user stories and an integration server. We also make use of &ldquo;story point&rdquo;, but for us, one point is one hour. We also use a burndown chart to track the effort we make (as I said: rapid feedback).</p>


<p>It&rsquo;s also a learning experience for me. I got to read a lot more and have been asked frequently to give feedback. So I&rsquo;m not letting myself go with the flow and only live the experience, but I am asked to participate actively. In the past, I have been on an agile team but as a remote worker (and a lot of distraction at the time, read : new house) and did not fully lived the experience. I also tried by myself on a lot of one-person project but, it&rsquo;s not just the same.</p>


<p>We have configured a build server and now we are trying to write more tests (just me for the moment, since I got &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; experience with that (3-4 years, wow time goes fast)).&nbsp; One thing I would like to apply as soon as possible is the use of TDD or BDD. But this one will be a lot harder to be approved since it&rsquo;s a considerable overhead when the team have no experience and a lot harder to get started correctly.</p>


<p>Happy to be back on the Agile train.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To be honest, I believe that we have reached a point where we can&rsquo;t allow ourselves to deliver untested software. I lived through a lot of maintenance work and debugging that were so time consuming that It took more time to debug than it took to actually develop. And it&rsquo;s for that reason that I believe that unit tests are essentials and should belong to every developer toolbox.</p>


<h3>Easy to get started</h3>


<p>It&rsquo;s actually not so hard to learn and a lot of resources already exists to get you started rapidly (<a title="Roy Osherove blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ROsherove/" target="_blank">Roy Osherove</a> and <a title="Art of unit testing" href="http://www.artofunittesting.com/" target="_blank">his book</a> are a must).</p>


<h3>Unit test and design</h3>


<p>I also believe that unit tests have a strong positive impact to the design of the code. Doing correctly, TDD (test-driven-design or test-driven development) is a powerful tool. I&rsquo;m talking with experience here and it&rsquo;s very impressive. I worked on two almost identical project and one was driven by test and the other was not. The quality of the design was much much better on the project that was test driven than the other one. But what was way more impressive was the number of changes made to the structure of the project. Code with tests has evolved tremendously and untested code had a static structure that stayed the same over the course of it&rsquo;s development.</p>


<h3>Unit test as a learning tool</h3>


<p>And a great one it is. I recently had to create regular expression to find email in some large text file. Instead of rapidly hitting google for a rapid solution, I created a class library, added the nUnit framework and started writing tests. This way, I could test assumptions and learn some aspect of writing regular expressions. I learned a lot.</p>


<h3>I can&rsquo;t believe!</h3>


<p>Today, I can&rsquo;t believe myself when I see a method that contains logical code, and no tests. Tests are so easy to do (when you actually know how to do them) that it&rsquo;s almost a shame to forget about them.</p>


<h3>My answer</h3>


<p>And here is my answer to the &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t do test because our organization don&rsquo;t want to&rdquo; argument : Don&rsquo;t tell them. You are responsible for the quality of your code and it&rsquo;s very unprofessional to leave code go in production that you knew would have been much better and feel more confident if it was tested. I believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages in this particular case.</p>


<p>This is my point of view.&nbsp;</p>
