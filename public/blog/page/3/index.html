<p>I choose a Linode 512 (with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) because we are not ready for full-scale deployment yet and did not wanted to pay for something we will not use fully for some time. The beautiful things is that we will be able to upgrade with no problems later on.</p>

<p>XP has a known issue when you are searching for text contained in files. Hopefully, there is a solution:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;309173">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;309173</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Time has come for me to finally announce that I now have launched my own company: <strong>Creatiom</strong>. Well, launched <strong>2 companies</strong>, but I can&#8217;t talk about the other one yet.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m probably very late on this, but I am now an almost fulltime consultant working for with a large company in North America.</p>


<p>I always had this dream to start my own business and provide something useful. I felt that I can have more impact and a whole lot more fun in the process. When the occasion presented itself I jumped on it.</p>


<p>But why did I start 2 companies? I have my one-person company which I started right off when I started consulting, but a month ago, 2 friends of mine had an interesting idea and asked me to join them. And I can say that I am really thrilled by this startup. It&#8217;s a great opportunity and a real challenge. I&#8217;ll still work on my own one-person product but for now, I concentrate everything I can on this opportunity.&nbsp;</p>


<p>But as a second big change, I may be minimizing my ASP.NET development to a minimum. I recently started doing everything with Ruby and Rails. And after 4 months, I can confidently say that I cannot imagine returning fulltime with ASP.NET. As much as I love .NET, Ruby has this little something that makes programming a lot more enjoyable. It&#8217;s a refreshing change, even though I&rsquo;ll need to work with linux (ubuntu) for now (I need a Mac!!).</p>


<p>I will mainly do web development and contracting for now. If you need work done, you can contact me, but I will only accept little projects (but try anyway, we never know).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last 3 weeks, I have been under enormous stress to deliver a critical piece of software. I wasn&#8217;t even sure that I could complete it under the remaining time, but I had to try and do my best.&nbsp;</p>


<p>But I am not here to talk about how things can get wrong, but what I have learned in that short time.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In those 3 weeks, I learned about:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Database synchronization</li>
<li>Microsoft Sync Framework</li>
<li>WCF</li>

<li>SQL Server CE</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>Updating application via Microsoft Application Updater</li>
<li>Basic Authentication and SSL</li>
<li>Fast unit testing (I haven&#8217;t considered putting them aside, even on a situation like this, I&#8217;ve already done that and regret it so much)</li>
<li>And that I need to sleep more than I think I need</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#160;</p>


<p>  <p>The time has come for me to add another language into my toolbox and I decided to look at a functional language : <strong><a title="Clojure&#39;s website" href="http://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a></strong>. I have the <a title="Programming Clojure book" href="http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure" target="_blank">Programming Clojure</a> book, so why not?</p>  <h3>Clojure is a modern Lisp language.</h3>  <p> Yes, Lisp (LISt Processing). I never thought I would have been near or around it. I heard so many bad things about his complexity and how it would not useful in real life scenarios. But I have heard sometime about programmers who expended their mind to new programming concept with it. The following comment seems to be universal from programmers who knows it well.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>     <br />I struggled to learn it, but once I finally get a grasp on it, it made me a better developer. </p> </blockquote>  <h3>Why?</h3>  <p>In our imperative language (Java, C#, Ruby, etc.) there is really no support for multi-core processing. That is, your program will only run on one core. Clojure is designed to support multi-core in mind and had support for dealing with concurrency really well.</p>  <h3>What is Lisp?</h3>  <p>   <br />From Wikipedia : </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church&#8217;s lambda calculus. It quickly became the favoured programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, and the self-hosting&#160; compiler.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Just that. And I would like to add that it had a lot of parentheses. A lot.</p>  <h3>Clojure is emitting JVM bytecode and goes hand in hand with Java but maybe not.</h3>  <p>   <br />I was afraid of that. I know Java, but not the whole library. Since Clojure can and will use the library, you better know where you are heading. But again, if you want to learn fast, just jump in the shark pool. But, Java is absolutely not required to program with it if you don’t want to.</p>  <h3>Clojure Code</h3>  <p>   <br />Let&#8217;s look at an example :     <br /></p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:57F11A72-B0E5-49c7-9094-E3A15BD5B5E6:a41312cd-13d0-4502-b5a3-9079603e6e25" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><pre style="background-color:#FFFFFF;white-space:-moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;overflow: auto;"><span style="color: #000000;">(loop [result [] x </span><span style="color: #800080;">5</span><span style="color: #000000;">]</p>

<pre><code>(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #0000FF;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt; (zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt; x)
    result
    (recur (conj result x) (dec x))))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;!-- Code inserted with Steve Dunn's Windows Live Writer Code Formatter Plugin.  http://dunnhq.com --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
  <br />Output : [5 4 3 2 1] </p>




<p>This snippet of code is actually a loop from 5 to 1 and appending each time the current index to an array</p>




<p>This is not a tutorial but let’s dig deeper at (zero? x). In Clojure, a function that evaluate a condition have the name of it appended of an ?. So zero? is the function name and x is the argument. Yes, you read right, you don’t supply function’s argument like other programming language where it would look like : </p>




<div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:DFDE9937-D816-47f4-A306-7B60D5CE5AC0:bcaad55b-8b3b-4d8c-8d5d-17419d286f29" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><pre class="brush: csharp; gutter: false; first-line: 1; tab-size: 4;  toolbar: false; ">bool isZero = IsZero(x);</pre><!-- Code inserted with Steve Dunn's Windows Live Writer Code Formatter Plugin.  http://dunnhq.com --></div>




<h3>Conclusion</h3>




<p>I tried to present a little introduction to Clojure without going into too much details. I am not yet comfortable with every concept and what would be the advantages in real life. But, It will be an interesting trip. After a little more than three weeks now, and almost 10 hours of playing around and I can already say that I will need to see things differently.Very differently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back when I was young (I&rsquo;m 28), I was a gamer. I could play for hours and get almost no sleep just to play games. Every games and only good rated games. I could complete several ones in just one week. I was at one point a really big fan of the Warcraft series (not WoW by the way) and got ranked really high on Battle.Net. But life goes on and I reduced my average playing time to the minimum (and I am a new father, so it&rsquo;s really not that much). Now I only play games that fit into the kind I love and that I know will not be crappy.</p>


<p>I could say the same thing to the time I now spend learning new programming stuff. I&rsquo;m more picky at what I choose and tend to ignore a lot of thing that I would have found interesting if I had time to read them. So I need to choose really carefully what I decide to involve myself into, and spend the less possible time on learning anything that I could find easily with some googling.. I also ignore stuff that come and go quickly (Cardspace?). I understand the inner plumbing, but the implementation details are not so important unless it&rsquo;s something I really need to (example : I needed to create a secure WCF service, but It&rsquo;s not something I use daily and will probably not use it again in the next year, so why should I choose to learn everything about securing a wcf services?).</p>


<p>But in my early years of programming I would have done it. I mean, learn all that I can and purchase new books every weeks. But the reality kick-in quickly and it&rsquo;s just not possible anymore.</p>


<h2>How do I keep up to date and not become crazy trying to learn everything ?</h2>


<p>1. I read blog. No, I read blog title and choose only what I think will be interesting for me.</p>


<p>2. I read books. But only great books. Other people already done the job of finding good ones. So I am not loosing my time on less than average book.</p>


<p>3. I work on my own project on my own time. I find it to be great to feel involved in all the stage of creating an application. UI, architecture, design, deployment, redaction, marketing, etc&hellip;</p>


<p>4. Watch screencasts. <a title="Dime Casts.Net -- Inform and Educate in ~10 Minutes or Less" href="http://dimecasts.net/">Dime Casts.Net</a> and <a title="TekPub - High-quality screencasts for programmers." href="http://tekpub.com/">TekPub</a> (maybe someday, I will buy a subscription).</p>


<p>So the question is: what do you do to keep up to date with everything and not let yourself become a programming zombie?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Frankly, I never liked the fact of buying a game online and never hold a physical copy. Before some 3 months ago. There was a game (<a title="Torchlight's website" href="http://www.torchlightgame.com/">Torchlight</a>) that I wanted to try right away, but unable to find it in store (here it&#8217;s almost impossible to get a decent game if you don&#8217;t go to the &#8220;big city&#8221;). I would have ordered through Amazon but a quick googling led me to Steam where the game has a 50% rebate on it.</p>


<p>If you don&rsquo;t know, <a title="Steam Powered Website" href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> is basically an online game retail store. Back to the point.</p>


<p>I enjoyed the experience. Checkout was fast, download the game was fast and the addition Steam has made to the game (like achievements) had a positive impact on me. Heck, your save games are stored on the <a title="Clould Computing on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">CLOUD</a>, how cool is that! I can play on my 3 computer and never have to worry of that.</p>


<p>And they have really big discount on weekend. And even free trials (Multiplayer Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s hard, keeping the pace and finding interesting subjects to write about, but at the same time I enjoy seeing that I can help or entertain (maybe)&nbsp; someone.</p>


<p>I made a decision and decided to write first for myself about things that interest me, instead of trying to interest everyone. If you happen to like what I&#8217;m writing about (even if I gave no specific direction to my blog), subscribe to my feed and I will try to just be myself and have fun in the process.</p>
