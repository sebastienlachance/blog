<p>I have enjoyed it so much that I had to sent an email to Andy Hunt (the author) to tell him how much I appreciated his effort to write this wonderful book.</p>


<blockquote>
<blockquote>I have just finished reading Pragmatic Thinking and Learning a few moments ago and I believe it&#8217;s a wonderful book.</blockquote>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<blockquote>I haven&#8217;t had much interest in reading computer related book so much as this one for a long time. I have a strong interest in the content you provided and will begin to apply what I can right now. Starting by re-reading the book and doing a Mind Map to be sure I picked all the interesting stuff.</blockquote>
<p>Excellent!&nbsp; If you have a chance, please post some happy comments like these on <a href="http://amazon.com">amazon.com</a>.&nbsp; It really helps.       <br />Good luck, and all the best!       <br />/\ndy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>This book is about the process of learning and thinking. How the brain works. But with an programmer point of view.&nbsp; Andy Hunt start by showing the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition which is describing the different type of skill level and how you go between them. Just for the info, the Dreyfus model has 5 levels : Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, Expert. He describe each level in detail and how to recognize it. And most importantly, how to act accordingly.</p>


<p>He also describe the R and L mode (left brain and right brain) and how to improve the flow between them. This is how you can remember think without thinking.</p>


<p>There is also a lot of the content dedicated to various method to &ldquo;refactor&rdquo; your brain. Each one is focused on being a better learner or to think more efficiently. Morning pages, mind map, SQ3R, etc.</p>


<p>I even had to apply some techniques described right away. Doing a mind map of what I&rsquo;m trying to figure out or when I&rsquo;m trying to absorb knowledge has helped me tremendously. It&rsquo;s been almost a month now and I see some improvements.</p>


<p>I like to learn something new everyday and care a lot of the quality of what I am learning. So, it&rsquo;s the reason I must give 4.9 star out of 5 (and yes, I will post a review on Amazon Mister Hunt).</p>

Steve Sanderson has created a poster that will help me better understand the request pipeline. I have been looking for a long time for a resource like this, I&rsquo;m a visual learner (I think) and seeing the plumbing visually is just great.</p>

If you haven&rsquo;t read it yet, go read it and be objective.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>Simple is better, less is better</h3>


<p>I agree with him, really! Not totally, but the essence of what I believe is written there. It&rsquo;s all about simplicity. I want my code to be simple. If I need to figure out what it&rsquo;s doing, I will refactor it until I can understand it easily. And I will never consider the use of a framework or another piece of technology if I really don&rsquo;t need it. Adding things for fun or for learning purpose can be fun, but it&rsquo;s not the most important aspect of software development.</p>


<p>I just want to stay away from complicated stuff. Simpler is better. Less is better. If there is a way to accomplish a task easily without a grandiose architecture, then I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>


<p>And don&rsquo;t forget that the ultimate goal is to ship it!</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>TDD</h3>


<p>But, I refuse to let TDD down. I don&rsquo;t know why everyone else is talking about Joel hatred concerning unit testing (am I to only one not reading his blog religiously?) but I need to put my feet here and give my opinion about TDD in this context. TDD allow me to write simple code. Just what is needed and nothing else. I don&rsquo;t think it slows me down. I don&rsquo;t think it gave me a lot more speed on my productivity, but it sure as hell helped me a lot in making things simple. But! Yes It could slow down dramatically a new team that has never done any sort of unit testing. Why not, you need to think a lot more of how you are going&nbsp; to do things and it&rsquo;s not easy to get out of the &ldquo;write and forget about until we test&rdquo; state of mind.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>TDD and 100% code coverage</h3>


<p>One of the aspect of unit testing that can be a problem is the 100% code coverage mark. Most people are trying to test everything and will put a lot of effort in it. Why should it be important to cover every single line of code. Not everything should be tested. Automatic property in C# should not be tested. Use your judgement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me start by telling you that I strongly believe in agile software development. Agile for me is about rapid feedback, improvement and a chance for all team members to give their opinions (and a lot more). Far too often I have seen developers only following wishes and desires of their lead programmer and never been asked for their opinions (it&rsquo;s not a personal experience but this is what I have heard many times). And I don&rsquo;t think it works.</p>


<p>Recently, I have been assigned to help a team that just got started on the agile path. They want to do it with Scrum and XP. I have not been sent specifically to help them with the agile transition but since I got some experience I think I could be of some help.</p>


<p>The new team has a great willingness to learn and improve themselves and finding a better team and a better project would have been possible for this transition. If there is a team that will successfully make it happen, it&rsquo;s them. Our Scrum master is using the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches" target="_blank">Scrum and XP from the Trenches</a>&rdquo; book written by <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/" target="_blank">Henri Kniberg</a> as a reference and so far, it&rsquo;s working amazingly. I did not had time to read it yet, but I plan to purchase the book as soon as I have some free time (I&rsquo;m getting married and having a baby).</p>


<p>We are experimenting different things and and seeing by ourselves what works and what is not. So far we already implemented the daily meeting, user stories and an integration server. We also make use of &ldquo;story point&rdquo;, but for us, one point is one hour. We also use a burndown chart to track the effort we make (as I said: rapid feedback).</p>


<p>It&rsquo;s also a learning experience for me. I got to read a lot more and have been asked frequently to give feedback. So I&rsquo;m not letting myself go with the flow and only live the experience, but I am asked to participate actively. In the past, I have been on an agile team but as a remote worker (and a lot of distraction at the time, read : new house) and did not fully lived the experience. I also tried by myself on a lot of one-person project but, it&rsquo;s not just the same.</p>


<p>We have configured a build server and now we are trying to write more tests (just me for the moment, since I got &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; experience with that (3-4 years, wow time goes fast)).&nbsp; One thing I would like to apply as soon as possible is the use of TDD or BDD. But this one will be a lot harder to be approved since it&rsquo;s a considerable overhead when the team have no experience and a lot harder to get started correctly.</p>


<p>Happy to be back on the Agile train.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To be honest, I believe that we have reached a point where we can&rsquo;t allow ourselves to deliver untested software. I lived through a lot of maintenance work and debugging that were so time consuming that It took more time to debug than it took to actually develop. And it&rsquo;s for that reason that I believe that unit tests are essentials and should belong to every developer toolbox.</p>


<h3>Easy to get started</h3>


<p>It&rsquo;s actually not so hard to learn and a lot of resources already exists to get you started rapidly (<a title="Roy Osherove blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ROsherove/" target="_blank">Roy Osherove</a> and <a title="Art of unit testing" href="http://www.artofunittesting.com/" target="_blank">his book</a> are a must).</p>


<h3>Unit test and design</h3>


<p>I also believe that unit tests have a strong positive impact to the design of the code. Doing correctly, TDD (test-driven-design or test-driven development) is a powerful tool. I&rsquo;m talking with experience here and it&rsquo;s very impressive. I worked on two almost identical project and one was driven by test and the other was not. The quality of the design was much much better on the project that was test driven than the other one. But what was way more impressive was the number of changes made to the structure of the project. Code with tests has evolved tremendously and untested code had a static structure that stayed the same over the course of it&rsquo;s development.</p>


<h3>Unit test as a learning tool</h3>


<p>And a great one it is. I recently had to create regular expression to find email in some large text file. Instead of rapidly hitting google for a rapid solution, I created a class library, added the nUnit framework and started writing tests. This way, I could test assumptions and learn some aspect of writing regular expressions. I learned a lot.</p>


<h3>I can&rsquo;t believe!</h3>


<p>Today, I can&rsquo;t believe myself when I see a method that contains logical code, and no tests. Tests are so easy to do (when you actually know how to do them) that it&rsquo;s almost a shame to forget about them.</p>


<h3>My answer</h3>


<p>And here is my answer to the &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t do test because our organization don&rsquo;t want to&rdquo; argument : Don&rsquo;t tell them. You are responsible for the quality of your code and it&rsquo;s very unprofessional to leave code go in production that you knew would have been much better and feel more confident if it was tested. I believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages in this particular case.</p>


<p>This is my point of view.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a list of common errors I had while working with the System.Diagnostics.Process class. I listed all solutions that worked for me.</p>


<h3>Couldn&#8217;t connect to remote machine.</h3>


<p><strong>Solution 1</strong> : Open MMC (Start/Run/mmc), add the Services snap-in and enter the name of the machine you are trying to connect to. This should give the exact reason it&rsquo;s failing.</p>


<p><strong>Solution 2</strong> : The inner exception could give you more information.</p>


<p><strong>Solution 3</strong> : You need server permission.</p>


<p><strong>Solution 4</strong> : Common on Windows 7 and Vista, start the <strong>Remote Registry</strong> service.</p>


<h3>The RPC server is unavailable</h3>


<p><strong>Solution </strong>: Turn on <strong>File and printer sharing </strong>and make sure the firewall is configured to allow access.</p>


<h3>Access Is Denied</h3>


<p><strong>Solution</strong> : In case nothing worked out of Google, try this : Open Local Security Policy and make sure the <strong>&ldquo;Set Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts&rdquo;</strong> to <strong>Classic.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, it&#8217;s another meta-blogging post (see Jeff Atwood post on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000297.html" target="_blank">meta-blogging</a>). But I think it&#8217;s a relevant one. I finally made the big move and decided to use an hosting provider to host my blog. And more importantly, I switched from <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> to <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/" target="_blank">BlogEngine.Net</a>.</p>


<p><strong>How I made the choice to go with BlogEngine.NET?</strong></p>


<p>Back in July, I decided to create my own blog engine. So I began the development with exactly what I had in mind for the most fantastical blog ever. After a week and really slow progress (I was sure to finish development by the beginning of August, 1 month later), I decided to look at other blog engines to gather idea on architecture and what is needed to be implemented. I looked at Oxite and BlogEngine.NET (since they are in .NET). I had a big surprise. I haven&#8217;t realized coding your own blog was so much work. In fact, BlogEngine.NET was already doing everything that I wanted (except for extension-less url).&nbsp;</p>


<p>And the ability to write your own theme is so easy! The BlogEngine.NET really did done a good job.</p>


<p><strong>How was the migration?</strong></p>


<p>Horrific. WordPress use a proprietary format and can&#8217;t be imported directly into BlogEngine.NET. But it was no big deal since I wanted to reread all post and correct spelling and bad grammar, I decided to recreate them all. I used the WordPress statistics to know which post were the most read and done them first.</p>


<p><strong>Uploading to GoDaddy.</strong></p>


<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in hosting server. I guess the experience was relatively easy, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that I abandoned after 2 hours and when getting back, everything was working as expected. The important thing is that it worked and it&rsquo;s fast.</p>


<p><strong>My apologies to Wordpress.</strong></p>


<p>I have nothing against you, really. You are a great service and a wonderful blogging platform. For 2 years you made blogging a unique experience. But my world is in .NET and you are not written in it. But again, thank you!</p>
