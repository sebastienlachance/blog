I always has this dilemma when I'm about to choose a tool to get the job done. Is that the better? I'm I loosing my time with this tool when there is another that does the job one hundred time better?

<p>And then, came <em><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/Tools">"the list"</a></em> from Scott Hanselman. It's a very complete one evaluated by someone who has experience with them. A lot of tools I'm using right now come directly from that list and has influenced my productivity a lot. For example :</p>
<ul>
	<li>SlickRun</li>
	<li>Windows Live Writer</li>
	<li>FireBug</li>
	<li>TestDriven.NET</li>
	<li>Colibri</li>
	<li>Skype</li>
	<li>Acronis</li>
	<li>7-Zip</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I highly encourage you to check <em><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/Tools">"the list"</a></em> and don't hesitate to try some of them. You could easily find one that will stick around for a while.
