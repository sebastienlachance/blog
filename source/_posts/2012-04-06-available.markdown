I am now available to do freelance web development. Contract or on site.

I have experience in ASP.NET (MVC or WebForms) and Ruby On Rails. HTML, Javascript and CSS, no problem.

You can see my CV here ([CV](/resume)).

I can be on site if you are in the area or work remotely (I also have experience in that).

I am looking forward to accept new challenges and deliver WORKING solutions!

You can contact me here (<a href="http://twitter.com/slachance">Twitter</a>), ([LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastienlachance)) or here (at sebastien.lachance creatiom.com).
