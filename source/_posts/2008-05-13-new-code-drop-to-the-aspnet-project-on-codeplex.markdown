<li><strong>05/12 Source code release of the ASP.NET AJAX Script Profiler helper control:</strong> To support the ASP.NET AJAX script combining feature which shipped in the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 Beta release, we've added the ASP.NET AJAX Script Profiler helper control source and binaries to this project. This control helps you to identify the scriptreferences used in your ASP.NET AJAX page to use with ASP.NET AJAX script combining. You can find this release here: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=13356">ScriptReferenceProfiler Source and Binary Release</a>. In addition this control is used in a Screencast for ASP.NET AJAX script combining on the ASP.NET site. </li>
