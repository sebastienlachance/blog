I have now officially started the development for my new web application. I will not go into details right now, since everything is to be made, and a lot of very important decisions are to be made.

What I can say is that it will be a Web Application running on Rails. I'm still struggling on whether to use PostgresSQL, MySQL or MongoDB. 

One of the big design decision was the choice of the client-side framework. I know I wanted a rich and fast user experience and to use Javascript heavily. So, I decided to go with [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/ "Backbone.js"). And I have no experience with it apart from the [Peepcode screencasts](http://peepcode.com/products/backbone-js "Backbone.js on Peepcode").

I have no idea how to apply it to my application domain. It will be hard, but worth it.

## What is Backbone?

**Backbone is a framework to create data-driven application in Javascript.**

As much as I love CoffeeScript, I will not use it to learn Backbone. 

I will use Jasmine for testing.

## Why Backbone and not Knockout or any other javascript framework?

From what I heard, Backbone is hard to learn, but from those who use it, it's totally worth a try. And I heard so much great things from a lot of different developers. They couldn't be all wrong. 

So let's get coding. Expect another blog post later for the first impressions.
