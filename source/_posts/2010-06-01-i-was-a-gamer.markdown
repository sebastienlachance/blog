<p>Back when I was young (I&rsquo;m 28), I was a gamer. I could play for hours and get almost no sleep just to play games. Every games and only good rated games. I could complete several ones in just one week. I was at one point a really big fan of the Warcraft series (not WoW by the way) and got ranked really high on Battle.Net. But life goes on and I reduced my average playing time to the minimum (and I am a new father, so it&rsquo;s really not that much). Now I only play games that fit into the kind I love and that I know will not be crappy.</p>
<p>I could say the same thing to the time I now spend learning new programming stuff. I&rsquo;m more picky at what I choose and tend to ignore a lot of thing that I would have found interesting if I had time to read them. So I need to choose really carefully what I decide to involve myself into, and spend the less possible time on learning anything that I could find easily with some googling.. I also ignore stuff that come and go quickly (Cardspace?). I understand the inner plumbing, but the implementation details are not so important unless it&rsquo;s something I really need to (example : I needed to create a secure WCF service, but It&rsquo;s not something I use daily and will probably not use it again in the next year, so why should I choose to learn everything about securing a wcf services?).</p>
<p>But in my early years of programming I would have done it. I mean, learn all that I can and purchase new books every weeks. But the reality kick-in quickly and it&rsquo;s just not possible anymore.</p>
<h2>How do I keep up to date and not become crazy trying to learn everything ?</h2>
<p>1. I read blog. No, I read blog title and choose only what I think will be interesting for me.</p>
<p>2. I read books. But only great books. Other people already done the job of finding good ones. So I am not loosing my time on less than average book.</p>
<p>3. I work on my own project on my own time. I find it to be great to feel involved in all the stage of creating an application. UI, architecture, design, deployment, redaction, marketing, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>4. Watch screencasts. <a title="Dime Casts.Net -- Inform and Educate in ~10 Minutes or Less" href="http://dimecasts.net/">Dime Casts.Net</a> and <a title="TekPub - High-quality screencasts for programmers." href="http://tekpub.com/">TekPub</a> (maybe someday, I will buy a subscription).</p>
<p>So the question is: what do you do to keep up to date with everything and not let yourself become a programming zombie?</p>
