<p>I needed to find an hosting company for our new product, and after a lot of though and hard decisions, we decided to go with <a href="http://www.linode.com/index.cfm">Linode</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I choose a Linode 512 (with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) because we are not ready for full-scale deployment yet and did not wanted to pay for something we will not use fully for some time. The beautiful things is that we will be able to upgrade with no problems later on.</p>
<p>Installing everything and got everything running in less than 2 hours. And I was pretty new to deploying a Rails application with mysql on linux.</p>
