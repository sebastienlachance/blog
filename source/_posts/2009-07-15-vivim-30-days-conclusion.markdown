<p>I&rsquo;m way too late to post the conclusion of the trial, but for all of you who wanted to know here are the results.</p>
<p>Will I continue to use vi/Vim in my everyday life? Probably. But not for a little while. The experience was fun but I did not find that my productivity increased a lot. I can&rsquo;t really say for sure. The problem I had was that I did not have a proper typing technique. So I found myself distracted because I was hitting the wrong key and caused side effects. So, I came to the conclusion that I needed to learn how to type properly.</p>
<p>I have already started to follow the lessons provided by <a href="http://www.typeonline.co.uk/">typeonline.co.uk</a>. And while typing with the proper skill in Visual Studio, I found myself missing <a href="http://www.viemu.com/">viEmu</a> real bad. I did not wanted to remove my hand from the keyboard to move around. Having seen what vi/vim was capable of, it&rsquo;s a huge way back.</p>
