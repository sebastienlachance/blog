<p>2009 has been a big year. A lot happened. Professionally and in my life in general.</p>
<h2>What went well</h2>
<h3>Reading other books than technical books</h3>
<p>I have been reading a lot of books that had nothing to do with the technical aspect of my job, but with other challenges in mind. I&rsquo;ve read about business development, learning process, design (not software design) and project management. I&rsquo;ve also came in contact with the Pragmatic Thinking and Learning book which gave me a lot of great tools to learn more effectively.</p>
<h3>Agile</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with an Agile Team for half a year now, going back where I really belong. I liked the experience and hope we (the team) can get even more benefits from this methodology this year. I&rsquo;ve also assisted to some of the conferences of the Agile Tour 2009 which was a fantastic event.</p>
<h3>Web Development and Javascript</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a developer with a little knowledge of web design but no deep knowledge. I&rsquo;ve always had design supplied to me and been able to hack through it and get thing done. This year, I&rsquo;ve gone deeply in web design and CSS, so deeply that I now really hate browsers differences :). And I&rsquo;m now an expert in Javascript, thanks to jQuery. Seriously, I made really big improvement on this side.</p>
<h3>SEO</h3>
<p>Search Engine Optimization that his. I was expected to increase visitors from the US on a website. I&rsquo;ve started with no real knowledge on how Google was indexing content. So I geared myself, watched videos and read everything I could for this. It&rsquo;s not always easy but it was a fun learning experience. One tool worth mentioning is the IIS SEO toolkit. The first analysis with this extensions showed me that I had a lot of problems with missing descriptions, keywords, titles, broken links, etc, on my blog, and it provided a great experience in allowing me to resolve them and understand what I did wrong.</p>
<h3>Wedding</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m now married. Since October 17. What an intense ride it was. And we are now waiting for our first child to be born (due February 2010).</p>
<h3>Consulting</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done some consulting work at the beginning of the year and it was really fun. Delivered on time and exactly what they wanted. Great experience. Great customer.</p>
<h2>What could have been better</h2>
<h3>Lack of time to post on my blog and the migration to BlogEngine.</h3>
<p>I have missed a lot of opportunity to blog and I intend to get back on track this year. I also migrated my blog from Wordpress to BlogEngine.Net this summer and seen a drop of more than 50% in traffic. I blame myself for my lack of migration strategy.</p>
<h3>Technical Reading</h3>
<p>I read some technical books in 2009, but not as many as the other years. In fact, aside from Clean Code, CSS Web Design and ASP.NET MVC in action, I had read no other technical book.</p>
<h3>A contract</h3>
<p>A situation has occurred in which I was unable to deliver a project on time. Some deadline were too thigh and a last minute change (technology switch at the last minute) made the situation goes havoc and the project was abandoned (by me).</p>
<h3>Skullcandy headphones</h3>
<p>I had a pair of Skullcandy headphones that broke unexpectedly. But due to the formidable warranty (complete replacement or half-price on another pair), I had sent them to be replaced in October. I&rsquo;m still waiting and all my attempt to contact them has failed. The problem is that I would have been able to repair them myself and now I&rsquo;ve just lost them.<br /><strong>Update 1 (January 14, 2010 : It seems the package never arrived&hellip;</strong>). <br /><strong>Update 2 (January 19, 2010 : Now they found it and the new headphones are being returned to me.</strong><br /><strong>Update 3 (February 11, 2010) : 3 weeks now and still haven't received them (Canada Post is slow or ...).</strong></p>
