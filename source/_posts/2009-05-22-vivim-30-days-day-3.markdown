<p>Not been typing much today, but I wanted at least to clear something. How do I cut/paste <strong>inside</strong> gVim.</p>
<p>First you need to enter the selection mode by hitting "v". Then move the cursor to select text using h, j, k, l, w, e, etc. When the text is selected, hit "d". This will cut the text. Now hit "p" to put the line back.</p>
<p>On another note, I talked about vi/vim to some of my colleagues and friends and everyone is just laughing at me. Everyone seems to agree that there is no points in learning this and should stick with "what everyone do". I do hope to show them what it's really about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
