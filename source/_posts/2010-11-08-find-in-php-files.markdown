<p>While working on a <a title="Drupal's website" href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> project, I had to search for a specific string contained in one of a lots of PHP code files. My first search led me to no result. I assumed that the little something I searched for might be embedded in a dynamic web page (Drupal allows this). I spent some time searching and found nothing. Today, as I worked on another feature, I came across the exact thing I searched for. Humm what could I have done wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP has a known issue when you are searching for text contained in files. Hopefully, there is a solution:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;309173">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;309173</a></p>
