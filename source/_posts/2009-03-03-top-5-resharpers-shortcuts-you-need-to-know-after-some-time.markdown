<p><strong>Important note&nbsp; : I am using ReSharper 2.x / IDEA keyboard mapping.<a title="2037992_1a3b63a3ce" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63483657@N00/3325543525/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/3575/3325543525_a1d8661a4a.jpg" border="0" alt="2037992_1a3b63a3ce" width="241" height="181" align="right" /></a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>CTRL-F12</strong></h3>
<p>With this shortcut you can navigate and search the list of methods of the class you are presently in.</p>
<p><a title="CtrlF12" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63483657@N00/3325542827/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/3540/3325542827_7d13d18b46.jpg" border="0" alt="CtrlF12" /></a></p>
<h3><strong></strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>ALT-Down Arrow / ALT-Up Arrow</strong></h3>
<p>Gives you the possibility of going to the next or previous member or method in your class.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>CTRL-P</strong></h3>
<p>Parameter info. It's over now. Over the time when you had to hit the backspace key and retype some characters to see the list of parameters the method will take poping up. Hit this shortcut and code with less keystrokes.</p>
<p><a title="CtrlP" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63483657@N00/3325542523/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/3629/3325542523_9dcd48812e.jpg" border="0" alt="CtrlP" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>CTRL-E</strong></h3>
<p>I have recently discovered this neat shortcut. It gives you a list of recent files you have edited and the possibility to quickly switch to any of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Backspace</strong></h3>
<p>Another recent discovery. It basically does the same thing as CTRL-E (Recent files you have edited), but with a small difference. You can navigate the list of changes you have made to your code. That's right, you can quickly go to any piece of code you have edited recently.</p>
