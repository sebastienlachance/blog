<p>A lot happen in the past weeks. First of all, this blog has reached 1000 visits. I'm extremely proud of that and I will try to maintain this constant growth. Next, my house is almost done, finally. This is a <a href="http://www.profab.ca/">Profab</a> house which is in the <a href="http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/residential/personal/new-homes/novoclimat.cfm?attr=4">NovoClimat</a> category. I expect to move in in 2 or 3 weeks.</p>
