<p>I know that I haven't posted the <a href="http://sebastienlachance.com/2008/10/08/currently-reading-jquery-in-action/" target="_blank">JQuery in Action</a> review yet, but I couldn't resist to finally read this book. In fact, I have the electronic version of it, but I needed a "real" book for long trip . <strong>Don't make me think</strong> by Steve Krug discuss usability problems and solutions. I first heard of this book by reading the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000020.html" target="_blank">Recommended Reading for Developers list</a>&nbsp;of Jeff Atwood. It's only about 200 pages but it's supposed to be filled with valuable content. Short reading time + Lot of new knowledge = Good for me!</p>
