<p>That was disastrous. No really. I had a lot of modifications to be made fast and it just seemed that viEmu was always in the way. I&rsquo;m not blaming viEmu here, it&rsquo;s just because I was not completely comfortable with it and I should had it deactivated for the rush. On another side, I learned how to do search without using Ctrl-F. Disturbing at first, a must now. 24 days left.</p>
