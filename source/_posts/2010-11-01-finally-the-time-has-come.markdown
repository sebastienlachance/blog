<p>Time has come for me to finally announce that I now have launched my own company: <strong>Creatiom</strong>. Well, launched <strong>2 companies</strong>, but I can't talk about the other one yet.</p>
<p>I'm probably very late on this, but I am now an almost fulltime consultant working for with a large company in North America.</p>
<p>I always had this dream to start my own business and provide something useful. I felt that I can have more impact and a whole lot more fun in the process. When the occasion presented itself I jumped on it.</p>
<p>But why did I start 2 companies? I have my one-person company which I started right off when I started consulting, but a month ago, 2 friends of mine had an interesting idea and asked me to join them. And I can say that I am really thrilled by this startup. It's a great opportunity and a real challenge. I'll still work on my own one-person product but for now, I concentrate everything I can on this opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as a second big change, I may be minimizing my ASP.NET development to a minimum. I recently started doing everything with Ruby and Rails. And after 4 months, I can confidently say that I cannot imagine returning fulltime with ASP.NET. As much as I love .NET, Ruby has this little something that makes programming a lot more enjoyable. It's a refreshing change, even though I&rsquo;ll need to work with linux (ubuntu) for now (I need a Mac!!).</p>
<p>I will mainly do web development and contracting for now. If you need work done, you can contact me, but I will only accept little projects (but try anyway, we never know).</p>
