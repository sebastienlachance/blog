<p>Do you remember Sam &amp; Max, Full Throttle and Day of the Tentacle (Dott!)? <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/" target="_blank">ScummVM</a> allow you to replay these "point and click" adventure games. You need to have the data file for them and you are ready to go. There are also different port: Nintendo DS, Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, etc... I think I'm gonna give it a try on the DS as soon as I have all the component. I would really like to play Monkey Island in the bus.</p>
