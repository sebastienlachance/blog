<p>Frankly, I never liked the fact of buying a game online and never hold a physical copy. Before some 3 months ago. There was a game (<a title="Torchlight's website" href="http://www.torchlightgame.com/">Torchlight</a>) that I wanted to try right away, but unable to find it in store (here it's almost impossible to get a decent game if you don't go to the "big city"). I would have ordered through Amazon but a quick googling led me to Steam where the game has a 50% rebate on it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know, <a title="Steam Powered Website" href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> is basically an online game retail store. Back to the point.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the experience. Checkout was fast, download the game was fast and the addition Steam has made to the game (like achievements) had a positive impact on me. Heck, your save games are stored on the <a title="Clould Computing on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">CLOUD</a>, how cool is that! I can play on my 3 computer and never have to worry of that.</p>
<p>And they have really big discount on weekend. And even free trials (Multiplayer Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2).</p>
