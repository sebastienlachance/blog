When I first started programming, I hated javascript (and hated web development i general, I wanted to go Windows Forms). As the years goes, I finally started to see something beautifull doint web. I really started to love it, really. But that's not the point.

Javascript was hard and a lot of bugs where always hauting me doing maintenance or bug fixes. When Ajax was starting to go mainstream and we started to do it with the .Net UpdatePanel. I was afraid. 

The jQuery came up. JQuery seemed to make everything easy and I started slowly to use it more in my projects. I was careful. Then I heard that some people were trying to do unit test on it and well, how could you do that.

Then Rails and ASP.NET MVC entered my life. This is a separate topic, but I think the mvc paradigm is the way to go until something really better take the place. It was a lot more easy to use javascript with your app (No automatic naming, grrrr ASP.NET WebForms).  

The reality really struck me earlier this year. Javascript is great and if you forget some of the bad stuff, there is something pretty great to be done with it. I started going all the way with it.

I still use jQuery a lot, but the exciting thing happening, is that I start to use it less and less for simple things that could be achieved without it. And starting to go OO with it (I still think I have a hell of a long way to be able to use that.)
