<p>Almost a month and a half now that my son is born. I could not imagine in how many ways it has changed my life (other than having no more free time :P).</p>
<p>That morning was probably one of the strangest and longest day I&rsquo;ve ever seen. After being told that we were waiting for a &ldquo;big&rdquo; baby (I am 6&rsquo;1 tall), we had the surprise of seeing a perfectly &ldquo;normal&rdquo; baby, weighted at 7lb13oz and measuring 21 inch after a long 14 hours.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve have learned so far&hellip; I will never say again that I&rsquo;m tired because I&rsquo;m lacking one or two hours of sleep. I&rsquo;ve had 4-5 hours of sleep in 4 days after he was born. And no matter how well I was prepared, I now see that I will have a lot to learn. It&rsquo;s unimaginable how every little things he does amaze me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really a wonderful gift of life, and I&rsquo;m planning to enjoy every moment of it.</p>
