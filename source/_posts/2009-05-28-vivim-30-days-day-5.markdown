<p>I&rsquo;m starting to really like this. I&rsquo;m much more confident and often I don&rsquo;t need to think twice before using a command. Today I have used many times the &ldquo;yank &amp; put&rdquo; keys along with v,V (selection)&nbsp; and o,O (new line before of after the current line). I am not required to think. So far, so good.</p>
