<p>I have just finished listening to the <a href="http://altnetpodcast.com/episodes/1-continuous-improvement">first episode of a new podcast</a>. It's a discussion about self-improvement for developer with Chad Myers, David Laribee and Jeremy D. Miller. It's very inspiring and I recommend that you listen to it if you are serious about software development.</p>
