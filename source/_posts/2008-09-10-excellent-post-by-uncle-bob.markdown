<p>Last week, I came across this <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2008/08/28/there-will-be-code" target="_blank">excellent post</a> by Robert C. Martin and had found it very interesting. We have seen an increasing amount of good tools to get the job done, but not a lot of improvements in computer languages. I'm delighted to see that there is now a lot of good developers who are working on improving languages. We have a bright future ahead of us!</p>
