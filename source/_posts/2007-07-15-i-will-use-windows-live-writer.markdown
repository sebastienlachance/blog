<p>Some months ago (when I was blogging on WDevs) I was using Windows Live Writer a lot. The only problem I had, was to configure it to actually see my blog. And today I have decided to give it a second try. And, wow, no problem at all. Everything is working perfectly. There is also some interesting plug-in that will enhance my experience (ex : Syntax Highlighting and Flicker4Writer).</p>
<p>This, has made my day. :)  <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/" title="Windows Live writer" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a></p>
