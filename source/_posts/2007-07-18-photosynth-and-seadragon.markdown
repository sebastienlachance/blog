<p>In case you have not seen this very cool presentation done at the TED conference, check this out there : <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/129" target="_blank">Photosynth</a>. This is a project I would do anything to work on it. They are reconstructing the Notre-Dame Cathedral with image from flicker. Can you imagine that! Unbelievable!  If you still have time to check another video, check the <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/96" target="_blank">Tony Robbins presentation</a>. I have read his book some years ago (his name in the french book is Anthony Robbins, translator have this crazy idea that name can be translated, by example : Buster in the Mythbuster show is called Jimmy) and he had help me a lot finding what I wanted to do in life. He is very entertaining and motivating.</p>
