<p>For a long time I wanted to have a personal knowledge base that I will use to keep all the code snippet frequently used. I was also needing a place to keep all my todos and useful code snippets. After reading the <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?r=1&amp;itm=4&amp;z=y&amp;EAN=9780470050651" target="_blank">LifeHacker book</a> (which is excellent by the way), I have decided to do a quick search for an online wiki. After some research, <a href="http://www.wikidot.com/" target="_blank">WikiDot.com</a> was the one that fit most of my criterias. I needed it to be private so nobody can see my personal stuff and most importantly, be free.  There is also <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">WikiSpaces</a> which is free, but if you want a private wiki, you will have to pay.</p>
