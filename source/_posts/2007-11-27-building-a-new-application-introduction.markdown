<p>I want to build an application and release it to the community. This is an application I had in mind for a long time. Basically, it’s a logging application. Not the one you would use to track requirements and time spent on a project. I’m talking about a logging application to log your weight, track your goals, what you’ve eat, do reports , etc. I know it’s something people want. I’m not doing it for money. I want to learn as much as possible and I think that writing code and solving new problems is a great way to learn. I have to take some basic decision at the beginning of the project and I must admit it will be a good excuse to make a list of all the new things (for me) that I want to use in the project and blog about them. This is an opportunity for me to take the time of using object-oriented techniques and becoming more agile. I will also blog a lot about that, because I find that blogging an interesting tool to learn and explaining to others help reinforce knowledge and being more confident. Also, posting about your goals, makes it a little harder to abandon too early.  </p>

<p>My requirements are the the following : </p> 

<ul> 
<li>Test-Driven development. I want a coverage of 95% at least.  </li>
<li>Building an continuous integration server.  </li>
<li>Applying at the best of my knowledge Object-Oriented principle.  </li>
<li>User stories.  </li>
<li>Identify mistakes as soon as possible and learn from them.  </li>
<li>Use a source control software and learn some of the best practices of source control management. </li>
</ul> 

<p>Technologies I want to use : </p> 

<ul> 
<li>It's a windows forms application in C#. </li>  
<li>Windows Presentation Foundation.  </li>
<li>.NET 3.5.  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/sqlmobile/sqlmobileresources.mspx">SqlCe</a> or <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite.</a>  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/product/default.aspx">Visual Studio 2008</a>.  </li>
<li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>.  <li><a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">NAnt</a>.  </li>
<li><a href="http://ncover.org/">NCover and NCover explorer</a>. </li> 
<li><a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET">CruiseControl.NET</a>.  </li>
