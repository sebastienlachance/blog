<p>I&rsquo;ve picked up a copy of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1254764175&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning</a> from Andy Hunt a couple of months ago. The book has 9 chapters and I am currently finishing the chapter 6. I am really impressed by the quantity of knowledge contained in it. I&rsquo;ve always had a strong interest in psychology and the learning process. In fact, everything that concern the brain. Expect a review very soon.</p>
