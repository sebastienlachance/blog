<p>It's finally there and now come with a "go-live" license. I have been waiting for a long time for it to be enough stable (never had any problem before) to use it for "real" clients (not for my own personal use).</p>
<p>I have been reading this <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/10/16/asp-net-mvc-beta-released.aspx" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC beta post</a> by ScottGu which is describing a bunch of new features and I found 2 that I personally find great.</p>
<p>The first one is about the new "Add View" menu. This option enable us to make a strongly typed view easily. Not that it was hard to do before. But it's a nice feature that will improve our experience with ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>The second most enjoyable feature is the addition of the FormCollection parameter to an action. Unit testing without requiring to mock anything is great.</p>
<p>And finally, ScottGu is talking about something new for ASP.NET WebForms in the new .NET 4.0. We will noew have complete control over the ClientId property.</p>
