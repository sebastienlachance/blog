<p>I was thinking about this for a while. If I have to choose five peoples who have influenced me the most concerning my career, who would that be?</p>
<p><strong>1. My first supervisor when I was a wielder.</strong></p>
<p><em>This guy once said to me that I would never do anything more than wielding in my life and if it wasn't for my father, he would have fired me for nothing. I promised him that It will not happen. Four years later, I was the leader of a small team in the company. Take that...</em></p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.bernard-voyer.com/index_en.html">Bernard Voyer.</a></strong></p>
<p><em>A famous explorator that I met when I was in school. He believed in his dream and have conquered the Everest, South Pole, North Pole and a lot of hard to reach places. He his just a normal person who gave everything he had to make his dream true.</em></p>
<p><strong>3. The ASP.NET guy.</strong></p>
<p><em>I don't remember his name , but it's shortly after I finished school. He had just completed a Microsoft Certification in ASP.NET. This is where I first heard the term MCSD and I promised myself I would be one (even though I had no idea what it was at that time). 2 years later, February 7 2006 at almost 9:00 PM, I was one. I learned all by myself with the help of some books and the requirement list on MSDN. It just felt incredible. Even if I'm no longer in the world of certification, I'm still very proud of it.</em></p>
<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>First blog ever that I have put in my RSS aggregator. I'm following him since a long time and he inspired me a lot. It's because of him that I am a blogger. He's coming to the .NET User Group of Qu&eacute;bec next week and I can't wait to meet him.</em></p>
<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/">Jean-Paul Boodhoo</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Never met the man. I first heard of him in an episode on DnrTv about design patterns. It seem he has a lot passion... If you have never heard of him, head here. I wish I was as passionate as him. I am, but he his more :).</em></p>
<p>This was my top 5 of the peoples who had the most impact on me. But I want to talk about a 6th person. He probably don't want me to talk about him so I will not give any name. Before meeting him, I was already into Agile development. But he taught me a lot about other aspect of the methodology. Everything that can't be learn in a book to be more precise. But thing haven't got very well at some point and after a lot of different events we lost touch. Anyway, I am very recognizing to have worked with him.</p>
