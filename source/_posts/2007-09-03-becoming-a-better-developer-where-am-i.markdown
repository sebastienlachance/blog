<p>I stopped completely drinking energy drink. Too much harmful effect. I also stopped drinking carbonated beverage a long time ago. For the rest I must admit it's a lot more difficult than I thought but I'm optimist. Not a single pound lost, but I want to start slowly by modifying my bad habits one by one.</p>

<p>As for my reading, I have 200 pages of Windows Forms 2.0 and 150 pages of CLR via C#. I'm enjoying this last one. I have learn a lot on the content of a DLL. As for the Windows Forms 2.0 book, I must admit that the interest is not there. I am not learning anything new and I feel that I'm studying for an exam. But there is some interesting chapter coming on next.</p>
