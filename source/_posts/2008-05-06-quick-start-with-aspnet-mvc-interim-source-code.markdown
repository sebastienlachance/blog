<p>This is intended to be a quick start for anyone who want to start playing with the latest version of ASP.NET MVC without going through the origin and goals of the MVC pattern. I will use the ASP.NET 0416 MVC Interim Source Code Release for this. Keep in mind, that this will probably all change in a near future.</p>
<p>First step, download and build the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=12640">source</a>. You will need to have the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">Moq</a> library (more about this mocking framework in a future post).</p>
<p>Second, download and install the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=12640">Visual Studio MVC Templates</a> (execute the vsi file).</p>
<p>Third, start an ASP.NET MVC project.</p>
<p>I have two useful resources to share with you. I believe they will give you a head start.</p>
<p>You have the <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">Scott Hanselman's screencast series</a> on the ASP.NET web site. And you have the <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/category/mvc-storefront/">MVC Storefront series from Rob Conery</a>.</p>
