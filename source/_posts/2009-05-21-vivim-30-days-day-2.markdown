<p>Day 2 of the trial, I have gone through half the tutorial (up to Lesson 3.3) and I begin to see where the power of this vi/vim residing. The most annoying thing so far is the color scheme/font that is not remembered, but I'm pretty sure it will have to do with learning vi (maybe a hidden command or something :P, or maybe not and will have to modify a config file somewhere).</p>
<p>Here is a recap of what I learned today</p>
<p>First, I have been using the "w" and "e" key to navigate through text in "Normal mode" (Normal Mode is where you are when you are not typing, hitting ESC get you there).</p>
<p>Next, the "x" key. Again, in normal mode, you hit the x key to delete the remaining of the words. If you are at the start of the word, it removes it completely and if you are at the second characters, it remove all remaining characters after the cursor.</p>
<p>This is it. I learned a lot through the tutorial but haven't used it much so it does not count. Tomorrow I will try a few new commands to keep learning it until I'm a master of vi/vim!!</p>
