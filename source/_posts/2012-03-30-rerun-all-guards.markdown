I have been searching this feature for a while and never realized it was built-in into Guard. Whenever I tried to rerun all with pressing enter, nothing happened. I didn't realized I was because of an old gem version.

    Ctrl-r if you are on Guard version < 7

and

    enter if you are on a more recent version
