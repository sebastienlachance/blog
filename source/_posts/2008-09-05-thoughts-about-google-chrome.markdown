<p>Like everyone else, I tried the new browser from Google. So far so good. As of today, I had no problem at all, except for some site that I could not log into. The major improvement I can see out of the box is the maximization of all the possible space and added an integrated html inspector. </p>  <p>They also added the search functionality right into the address bar. It makes only one shortcut to reminder. For a non-official version, it really is amazing. I expect a great future for Google Chrome.</p>
