<p>For the last 3 weeks, I have been under enormous stress to deliver a critical piece of software. I wasn't even sure that I could complete it under the remaining time, but I had to try and do my best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I am not here to talk about how things can get wrong, but what I have learned in that short time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In those 3 weeks, I learned about:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Database synchronization</li>
<li>Microsoft Sync Framework</li>
<li>WCF</li>
<li>WCF Data Services</li>
<li>OData</li>
<li>Entity Framework</li>
<li>Windows Forms</li>
<li>Running a standalone web application on an standalone web server</li>
<li>xulrunner (embedded Firefox)</li>
<li>XPO (DevExpress ORM)</li>
<li>SQL Server CE</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>Updating application via Microsoft Application Updater</li>
<li>Basic Authentication and SSL</li>
<li>Fast unit testing (I haven't considered putting them aside, even on a situation like this, I've already done that and regret it so much)</li>
<li>And that I need to sleep more than I think I need</li>
</ul>
<div>It's a lot of stuff. But the next part will be to summarize everything I learned in a document if I want to retain some of this stuff.</div>
