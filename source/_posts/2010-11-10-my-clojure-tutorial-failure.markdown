<p>I intended to write a full series of posts to help learn Clojure. While I was really enthusiasm about this, my recent change of plans has left me no choice but to abandon the idea of mastering this language. I didn't knew at that time that I'll had to learn Ruby for my new project and I have no more time to learn anything else right now. <strong>So, goodbye Clojure!</strong></p>
