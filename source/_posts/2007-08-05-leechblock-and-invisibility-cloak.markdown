<p>If you have been following my blog since the beginning, you probably know about Tower Defense Games. This is a real time killer. I have lost a lot of my free time just to see if I can get a  level higher. Then I have turned to simple solution like the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/greasemonkey/invisibility-cloak-update-149252.php">LifeHacker's Invisibility Cloak</a> which is really great. It blocks web site that you have added to this GreaseMonkey script. But another alternative that is simpler to use is the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4476">LeechBlock Firefox Add-On</a>. With this one, you can't deactivate it, if you have decided to use it. So it will really help I think .:)<br /><br /> <a title="leechblock" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63483657@N00/996834155/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1026/996834155_67dc9574a6.jpg" border="0" alt="leechblock" /></a></p>
