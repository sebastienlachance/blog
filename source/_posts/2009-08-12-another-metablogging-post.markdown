<p>Yes, it's another meta-blogging post (see Jeff Atwood post on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000297.html" target="_blank">meta-blogging</a>). But I think it's a relevant one. I finally made the big move and decided to use an hosting provider to host my blog. And more importantly, I switched from <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> to <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/" target="_blank">BlogEngine.Net</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How I made the choice to go with BlogEngine.NET?</strong></p>
<p>Back in July, I decided to create my own blog engine. So I began the development with exactly what I had in mind for the most fantastical blog ever. After a week and really slow progress (I was sure to finish development by the beginning of August, 1 month later), I decided to look at other blog engines to gather idea on architecture and what is needed to be implemented. I looked at Oxite and BlogEngine.NET (since they are in .NET). I had a big surprise. I haven't realized coding your own blog was so much work. In fact, BlogEngine.NET was already doing everything that I wanted (except for extension-less url).&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the ability to write your own theme is so easy! The BlogEngine.NET really did done a good job.</p>
<p><strong>How was the migration?</strong></p>
<p>Horrific. WordPress use a proprietary format and can't be imported directly into BlogEngine.NET. But it was no big deal since I wanted to reread all post and correct spelling and bad grammar, I decided to recreate them all. I used the WordPress statistics to know which post were the most read and done them first.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading to GoDaddy.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in hosting server. I guess the experience was relatively easy, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that I abandoned after 2 hours and when getting back, everything was working as expected. The important thing is that it worked and it&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p><strong>My apologies to Wordpress.</strong></p>
<p>I have nothing against you, really. You are a great service and a wonderful blogging platform. For 2 years you made blogging a unique experience. But my world is in .NET and you are not written in it. But again, thank you!</p>
