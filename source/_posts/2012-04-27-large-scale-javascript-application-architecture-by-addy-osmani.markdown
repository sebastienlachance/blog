Sometime, great stuff just fall from sky. And this presentation is just what I needed. [Addy Osmani](http://speakerdeck.com/u/addyosmani) (AOL) has made a presentation about [large-scale javascript application architecture](http://speakerdeck.com/u/addyosmani/p/scaling-your-javascript-applications) and has made his slides public on [Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com/) (which by the way is great).
