<p>I have been bouncing on various project on various editor and it this has made me think... What so good about ReSharper? And this has lead me to find five reasons not to use it.</p>  <h3>&#160;</h3>  <h3><a title="five" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63483657@N00/3291526156/"><img style="margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px" border="0" alt="five" align="right" src="http://static.flickr.com/3489/3291526156_23b14d8a7e.jpg" width="243" height="162" /></a></h3>  <h3>Reason #1 : I am not using Visual Studio. </h3>  <h3>Reason #2 : I did not possess or will never have a license. </h3>  <h3>Reason #3 : I will loose my job if I am too productive. </h3>  <h3>Reason #4 : I am not programming..</h3>  <h3>Reason #5 : Because you don't know it existed or your network administrator does not want you to install any third-party tools!</h3>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I'm sorry to have been misleading you with the title, but I have a profound respect for ReSharper. And if you sincerely doubt it will provide you any value, just try it for a couple of days(<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/">http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/</a>) and give me some news. </p>
