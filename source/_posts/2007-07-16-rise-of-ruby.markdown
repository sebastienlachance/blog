<p>2 years ago, someone told me Ruby will be the "next big thing". I told him "no way". C# will gain more and more popularity and ASP.NET 2.0 will totally rules. God, I was wrong. After 2 months of Ruby On Rails, I must admit it's here to stay. The ease of use of the Rails framework is impressive. In 30 minutes I have managed to create a little web application to keep track of my weight with complete support for creating/editing/deleting as well as listing all items. This was the first minute, the remaining 29 minutes was modifying the design and doing some CSS.</p>
<p>If you have never seen the coding of a blog engine by a ruby on rails programmer, then you must absolutely check this <a href="http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov" target="_blank">screencast</a>.  There is a lot more screencasts that will encourage you to go further on the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts" target="_blank">Ruby On Rails website</a>.  And a bonus for all of you who are already into ruby : <a href="http://railscasts.com/" target="_blank">RailsCasts</a></p>
