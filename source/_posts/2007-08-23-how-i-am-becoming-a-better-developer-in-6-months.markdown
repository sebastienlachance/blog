<p>Some time ago, I listened a <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=90">podcast from Scott Hanselman</a> which discussed about how to be a better developer in 6 months. Since I'm a huge fan of motivation blog and personal improvement, this subject tickled me almost everyday. And now, I am ready to announce my plan which is ending at the end of february.</p>
<p>I'm will <strong>read a book every 2 weeks and do a review for each of them</strong>, for a total of 12 books. Here is the list I thoroughly choosed :</p>

<p>Then, I will <strong>regain my health back</strong> by doing exercise every day and try my best to eat healthy food. I want at least to loose 10 pounds.</p>
<p>I want to <strong>finalize and distribute a little home project</strong> I made to track weight lost, track food consumption and can be used as a journal tool.</p>
<p>And I need to give credit where it's due. First of all, the guy who started it all : <a title="Justice Gray's twitter account" href="http://twitter.com/justicegray">Justice Gray</a>. I have also based my list of books on his because he seems to know a lot and he probably choose some really good books. I also want to thank <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman (very very great blog)</a> for making a podcast on this subject.</p>
