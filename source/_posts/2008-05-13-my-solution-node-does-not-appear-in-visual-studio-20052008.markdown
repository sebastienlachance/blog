<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/3l74od">A reader asked me</a> <strong>how we can display the solution node in Visual Studio</strong> when you have only one project. This feature is turned off by default. What you need to do is to go in your Tools/Options menu and click on <strong>Projects and Solutions</strong>. Then you need to check the Always Show Solution checkbox.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask me any questions.</p>
