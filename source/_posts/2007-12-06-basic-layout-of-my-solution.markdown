<p><a href="http://sebastienlachance.com/building-a-new-application-series/">(Index of the whole series)</a></p> <p>I have completely forgotten to show you the basic folder hierarchy of my solution. I invite you to try once to make a completely different folder hierarchy instead of the one Visual Studio suggest. Not that Visual Studio is a bad tool for this, not at all. I have learned that letting a tool do the folder management can lead on to unnecessarily complexity. Let me explain myself. There is an adage that say you should program into a language instead of programming in a language. Make Visual Studio work with your layout instead of using the default. I find interesting what you can learn when you organize yourself the layout of the solution.</p> <p>Anyway, let's see my folder structure :</p> <p><a title="solutionstructure" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63483657@N00/2089612716/"><img alt="solutionstructure" src="http://static.flickr.com/2313/2089612716_99787760e2.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>The <strong>build</strong> folder is where the compiled application will reside. When doing automated testing I will use this version.</p> <p>The <strong>config </strong>folder is where all the configuration files will be. I'll probably get rid of it real soon as I have probably found a way that work better for me.</p> <p>The <strong>lib</strong> folder contains library that are necessary for the project to be executed correctly.</p> <p>The <strong>sql</strong> folder will contains all the sql script. This is also considered to be removed.</p> <p>The<strong> src</strong> folder is composed of the <strong>app </strong>folder and the <strong>test</strong> folder. Each one contains a subset of all the projects (tests projects in the test folder and application in the app folder).</p> <p>The <strong>tools</strong> folder contains any tools that are not necessary to execute the solution but are needed for the development.</p> <p>It's basically all I need for now to begin iterating on my application (using User Stories of course). I must mention that I doing this in an iterative way and a lot of things are subject to change. Any comments are greatly appreciated and will be read and considered. </p> <p>I'm also considering to put all source file into Google Code. Stay tuned!</p>
