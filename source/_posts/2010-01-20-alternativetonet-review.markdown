<p><a title="AlternativeTo Web Site" href="http://alternativeto.net/" target="_blank">AlternativeTo</a> is a web site that suggests alternatives to a given application based on user recommendations. For example : TeamCity will have Hudson and CruiseControl and Windows 7 will have Windows Vista and Windows XP as an alternative. The web site is divided into 2 main category: desktop and mobile and can be further divided between OS (Windows, Mac, Linux or Online for the Desktop section and IPhone, Win Mobile, Android, Blackberry and S60 for the Mobile section).</p>
<p>The first things that came to my attention is the ease of use and the quality of presentation. It&rsquo;s just easy to find what you need to. It really is that interesting&nbsp; and I admit I return to them often when I&rsquo;m in need of an alternative software. They have release their beta version on March 2009.</p>
<p>Great job guys!</p>
<p><strong>PS: I have no relation whatsoever with AlternativeTo. I just find the concept interesting.</strong></p>
