<p>Some months ago, someone from Jetbrains asked me if they could use a comment I made on my <a href="http://sebastienlachance.com/post/Setting-up-a-basic-continuous-integration-server-with-TeamCity.aspx" target="_blank">TeamCity blog post</a> (the one I demonstrate how to get TeamCity up and running) on their testimonials page.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/company/customers/testimonials.html#tc" target="_blank">My testimonial</a>. However, I am not working anymore for bxsystems but for a great local company where I currently live. I think there is a lot of potential there.</p>
<p>I still believe TeamCity is an impressive product and I am waiting for <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2008/10/28/grab-yourself-one-of-the-last-eap-builds-before-the-teamcity-40-release/" target="_blank">version 4</a> that will be out soon.</p>
