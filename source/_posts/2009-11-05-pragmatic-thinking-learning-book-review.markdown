<p>I have enjoyed it so much that I had to sent an email to Andy Hunt (the author) to tell him how much I appreciated his effort to write this wonderful book.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>I have just finished reading Pragmatic Thinking and Learning a few moments ago and I believe it's a wonderful book.</blockquote>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<blockquote>I haven't had much interest in reading computer related book so much as this one for a long time. I have a strong interest in the content you provided and will begin to apply what I can right now. Starting by re-reading the book and doing a Mind Map to be sure I picked all the interesting stuff.</blockquote>
<p>Excellent!&nbsp; If you have a chance, please post some happy comments like these on <a href="http://amazon.com">amazon.com</a>.&nbsp; It really helps.       <br />Good luck, and all the best!       <br />/\ndy</p>

<p>This book is about the process of learning and thinking. How the brain works. But with an programmer point of view.&nbsp; Andy Hunt start by showing the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition which is describing the different type of skill level and how you go between them. Just for the info, the Dreyfus model has 5 levels : Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, Expert. He describe each level in detail and how to recognize it. And most importantly, how to act accordingly.</p>
<p>He also describe the R and L mode (left brain and right brain) and how to improve the flow between them. This is how you can remember think without thinking.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of the content dedicated to various method to &ldquo;refactor&rdquo; your brain. Each one is focused on being a better learner or to think more efficiently. Morning pages, mind map, SQ3R, etc.</p>
<p>I even had to apply some techniques described right away. Doing a mind map of what I&rsquo;m trying to figure out or when I&rsquo;m trying to absorb knowledge has helped me tremendously. It&rsquo;s been almost a month now and I see some improvements.</p>
<p>I like to learn something new everyday and care a lot of the quality of what I am learning. So, it&rsquo;s the reason I must give 4.9 star out of 5 (and yes, I will post a review on Amazon Mister Hunt).</p>
