<p>I am a big fan of <strong><a title="Evernote's website" href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a></strong>. I used to put everything from personal notes to ebook in it. But, it became so slow it was a pain to open it just to add a little something.</p>
<p>But they released version 4 with a very BIG performance improvement. I will now be able to resume my Evernote's normal usage.</p>
